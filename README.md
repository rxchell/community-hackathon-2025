## What is SafeShelter?
An AI tool that extracts and summarizes key info from uploaded documents (e.g. court, medical, social reports) to support shelter assessments/

**Vision:**
- A world where no one is left without shelter because of paperwork — where social workers are empowered with smart tools to focus on people, not paperwork.

**Mission:**
- We build AI-powered tools that extract and summarise key info from uploaded documents to help social workers assess rough sleepers faster and more accurately.

**Key Features:**
- Upload docs (financial, medical, legal, etc.)
- AI summarises and outputs suitability, room type, financial info
- Saves summary to individual profiles

**Inspiration:**
- UI Reference: Claude-style – editable AI output on the right
- Tech Inspiration: GovTech’s AIsay
